# Theorii-Discord-Bot
This discord bot is used to run a server of about 150 users for one of my friends. The main functionality of the bot is to change a user's name upon entering the server 
to a random ajective such as 'Theorii, but Quick'

Other than that this bot has a lot of other functionality such as pinging users when to get online or being able to grant permissions, ban users, mute users, and much more
